Assessment

Discussed alcohol use and its relationship to HTN. Darleene agrees to a trial of drinking wine only on weekend evenings.

Check home BPs.

Check potassium since she is taking a diuretic.

Follow-up in the clinic in 1 month. Bring a blood pressure diary to that visit. Consider adding ACE inhibitor at the next visit if BP is still elevated.
